# JavaSelfStudy
Documenting my learning journey with Java
Started est. August 2022, balancing full-time employment and studying over thee weekends and spare time
Got serious starting Jan 2023 since starting TFIP and fully-committed to be a proficient software engineer
Mainly using Udemy as my "teacher" and occasionally YouTube gurus if I am having issues understanding or need clarity
Feel free to look around, my mini projects are also in this repository under CodingExercise but will create a seperate one 
in the future when my projects gets bigger in scale and quantity
